# Tokio-serde-cbor

[![Travis Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/vorner/tokio-serde-cbor.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vorner/tokio-serde-cbor)
[![AppVeyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/omgsa9hhwd5cpmmc/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vorner/tokio-serde-cbor/branch/master)

This rust crate integrates the
[`serde-cbor`](https://crates.io/crates/serde-cbor) into a codec (`Decoder` and
`Encoder`) of [`tokio-io`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-io). This allows
turning an async read/write into a stream and sink of objects.

The API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rs/tokio-serde-cbor).

## Features
This crate has an optional dependency: `futures_codec`. When enabled it will allow you to frame
`AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` from the futures 0.3 crate. See the `futures` example in the example directory.

## Status

The API is not formally stabilized and may change. But the crate itself is
small and there's probably not much space for such changes.
